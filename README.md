# Shared and Distinct Neural Signatures of Feature and Spatial Attention 	

This is the repositiory for replicating main results in the paper: *Shared and Distinct Neural Signatures of Feature and Spatial Attention*. 

## Brief Description

In this study, we applied the whole-brain machine learning-based multivariate analysis  to unconver the neural signatures of feature attention and spatial attention with fMRI.
